### Griphy API
    This application first presents the user with a list of animal buttons. The user then has the 
    chance to enter any animal in the input field. They click the 'add' button and their new animal
    button gets added to the rest of the buttons. They can click on any button and the Giphy API pulls
    in gifs of that animal.
